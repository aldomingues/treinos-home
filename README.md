## This Project

This page is just a menu with links to each feature.
Initially everything was a single repository but now they are being separated.


## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
#or
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
